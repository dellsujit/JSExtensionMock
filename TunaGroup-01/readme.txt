# Halo Extension Application

## Overview
The Halo Extension Application is designed to integrate with the Simphony point-of-sale (POS) system, providing functionality to manage tender limits using the Halo concept. This application checks whether a transaction exceeds a predefined Halo value and processes it accordingly.

## Features
- Halo Value Management: Checks if the transaction total exceeds a specified Halo limit.
- Error Handling: Logs errors and manages transaction approval based on Halo limits.
- Modular Design: Utilizes a modular approach for clear separation of concerns.

## Working
- The Application tries to mock the Simphony environment via having context and datastore which in real case will be generated by POSClient.
- You can run the application on command line using npm test and feel free to modify datastore
- It requires a nodejs environment
